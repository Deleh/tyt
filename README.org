  Terminal YouTube (*tyt*) is a small bash script that lets you play YouTube videos by query from the command line.

** Features

   - Search and play videos with one command
   - Interactively select a video from a list
   - Download a video to the current working directory

   There is a =--music= flag, so you can substitute /video/ with /song/ in the above list.

** Execution

   This project is a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix flake]].
   If you have a recent [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] version and *flakes* are enabled, you can execute the script via:

   : nix run github:Deleh/tyt -- --help

   If not you can clone the repo, make sure the dependencies listed below are fulfilled and execute /tyt/ manually:

   : ./tyt --help

** Dependencies

   If you are running tyt as *Nix flake* you don't have to care about dependencies.
   A mpv version with scripts is used by default, this enables *MPRIS support* and *skipping sponsored segments* of videos.

   If you are not running Nix, make sure the following dependencies are installed on your system and hope that everything works:
